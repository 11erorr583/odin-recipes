<h2> Method: </h2>
<p>To prepare a <string>classic herb-butter roast chicken</string>, start by preheating your oven to <i>425°F (220°C)</i> and ensuring the bird is at room temperature.
     The most critical step for achieving crispy skin is to <i>pat the chicken completely dry with paper towels inside and out</i>. Once dried, generously season the internal cavity with <b>kosher salt and pepper</b>,
      then stuff it with a halved <b>lemon</b>, a head of <b>garlic</b> cut <b>crosswise</b>, 
    
    
    and a bundle of fresh rosemary, thyme, and sage.
     To ensure succulent meat, rub a generous amount of softened unsalted butter both over the skin and underneath the skin of the breast,
      followed by a final sprinkle of salt and pepper on the exterior. Place the chicken on a bed of sliced yellow onions and olive oil in 
      a roasting pan, or on a roasting rack, and cook for approximately 50 to 70 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the thickest part of the thigh reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
       Finally, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for at least 15 to 20 minutes before carving; this allows the juices to
        redistribute, ensuring every slice is moist and flavorful. 
        For an extra touch of flavor, you can deglaze the roasting pan with chicken
         stock to create a simple, savory jus to <b>serve alongside the meat</b>.</p>
